# Mental-Health-Analysis
### What is Mental Health Illness?
Mental health is the foundation for emotions, thinking, communication, learning, resilience, hope and self-esteem. Mental health is also key to relationships, personal and emotional well-being and contributing to community or society.
According to Mental Health America, over half (56%) of adults with a mental illness in the US don't receive treatment, which amounts to over 27 million people.
### How does it affect businesses?
Employees experiencing mental health issues may struggle with concentration, decision-making, and completing tasks efficiently.
Decreased productivity can result from increased absenteeism (taking sick leave) and presenteeism (being physically present but mentally unwell and unproductive).
Companies that neglect mental health can suffer reputational damage, affecting their attractiveness to potential employees and customers.
